| Problem | University admission selection has become an important activity for prospective students with various backgrounds and abilities. With so many candidates applying to a university, the university will be overwhelmed in selecting the best candidates. There are several common selection methods, such as essay writing and interviews. In addition, candidates' education history and work experience are also examined, which are often similar to each other. |
| Machine learning solutions | Screening of essays and interviews can be done by professionals in the field directly for better results, but screening of grades and other administrative requirements has the potential for errors due to the large amount of information received at once. This is also information that is received in advance so it would be helpful if machine learning is applied to provide feedback on the initial screening results for candidates to speed up the process. |
| Data preprocessing | In the dataset, there are features consisting of education history, work experience, and acceptance status (the original data contained candidate numbers that were removed because they were unused). Acceptance status was set as the target variable (the target variable was originally categorical, but was transformed to numeric before use). Numerical variable values are transformed with data scaling (range 0-1) to make them more consistent. Then, categorical variables are converted to numbers with one-hot encoding so that they can be used in training. The target variable is converted to an integer. The converted variables will be renamed with the addition of "_xf". After being transformed, the data is divided into train and test data with a ratio of 80:20. |
| Model architecture | The model architecture uses a concatenate layer at the beginning to combine the transformed features, then a Dense 8 layer with relu activation is used. After that, there is a classification layer with Dense which uses sigmoid activation because the output is binary (0 or 1). In the training process, the Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.001, loss binary crossentropy, and metrics binary accuracy. The binary type is used because this case addresses binary classification (2 classes). |
| Evaluation metrics | The evaluation metrics used in this case are Binary Accuracy and Loss.
| Model performance | The model performance is good when viewed from the binary accuracy and loss metrics. In val_loss, the model has a loss of 0.276. Meanwhile, the training loss is also small at 0.166. As for accuracy, the training accuracy reaches 92.6% while the validation accuracy remains stable during the training process at 86.7%. This indicates that the model does not have overfitting because there is not much difference between the training and validation scores.|
| Deployment | The Railway platform is used for model deployment to the cloud, Railway can be accessed with PowerShell. |
| Web app | [campus-selection-classification-model](https://campus-selection-classification-production.up.railway.app/v1/models/campus-selection-classification-model/metadata) (App Deactivated) 
| Monitoring | The monitoring of the model is done with the Prometheus platform via Docker. An example of monitoring used in the model is displaying incoming requests. |
